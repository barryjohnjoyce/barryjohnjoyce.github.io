# Band Website
 
## Overview

### What is this app for?
 
This is the prototype frond-end website for the fictional band Union City.
 
### What does it do?
 
The website showcases the band and publicises their availability for gigs. 

### How does it work? 

The website is designed from a blank HTML page but is styled with Bootstrap and uses HTML form validation. I have used
the Code Institute's Project Resources folder for songs, videos, pics etc.
 
## Features

Fans can see and hear clips from the band's back catalogue and also new material as it becomes available. There are photos and bios of the
band members. Fans and commercial enterprises can contact the band though the Contacts Page and subscribe to a newsletter. Potential customers
can check dates for future bookings. There are working links to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for future use.


## Tech Used

### Some the tech used includes:

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap has been used for certain design elements such as the navbar. The compiled javascript in Bootstrap is
    also used to activate a Carousel. Media queries are used to make elements repsonsive.

- [Fonts]
    - The band's logo has been designed using HTML, including the border-radius property and the Copperplate font.

- [Calendar]
    - a HTML calendar available for free from the Web has been utilised.

- [iTunes API]
    - The "Our Music" page is linked to the iTunes API to allow fans to search for and purchase the band's commercial tracks.
